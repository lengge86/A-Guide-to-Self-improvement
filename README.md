# The Introduction

Please note:  
*The project is still in a very early progress.*  
*The project is very personal.*  


The guide is for people who want to improve themselves by their own. You don't need to ask your family or friends for help, and don't need to pay for it at most situations.  

Self-improvement consists of two parts: reading materials, and exercise.  


The guide consists of three parts:

**in-it-self**:   
know what determine your personality: genes and families

**for-it-self**:  
Know how you interact with others and yourself, and how to change it

**in and for itself**  
know, improve and maintain your self-esteem
